* **...:**
* **jjJ--LSJ transformation:** LSJ expansion & notations of atoms with one (nonrelativistic) open 
    shell *(12.7.19)*

* **Breit interaction:**  Implementation of the frequency-independent Breit interaction amplitudes 
    that can be accessed via `AsfSettings(..., breitCI=true, ...)` in all configuration-interaction
    computations.  *(4.1.19)*
