    "In atomic and quantum many-particle physics, (the coupling of) angular momenta and spherical tensors play a crucial role for the the evaluation and spin-angular integration of many-particle matrix elements. This coupling often leads to algebraic expressions which are usually written in terms of generalized Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and/or Wigner 3nâ€“j symbols as well as the Wigner rotation matrices and spherical harmonics. Although the evaluation and simplification of such expressions is *in principle* a straigthforward task, it may become very cumbersome if complex systems or physical scenarios are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the pioneering work by Wigner in the late 1930s, in particular Racah developed a powerful machinery, known as **Racah algebra** today, in order to deal with the angular momentum of (rotational invariant) quantum many-particle systems. Briefly speaking, this machinery includes a number of strategies to simplify (so-called) **Racah expressions**. In JAC, these expressions are defined by a summation over Wigner n-j symbols of different kind(s) as well as (various integrals over) the spherical harmonics and Kronecker and triangular deltas, cf. User Guide, Section 15.1. Here, the summation may formally run over any number of angular momenta. Since all these symbols obey a rather high symmetry, the complexity of such Racah expressions increases very rapidly as more Wigner symbols, rotation matrices and or spherical harmonics appear in the (product) terms over which the summation runs.\n",
