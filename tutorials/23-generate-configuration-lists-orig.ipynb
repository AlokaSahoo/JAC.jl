    "Many atomic computations are built upon the term of a configuration or lists (respective arrays) of such configurations. These list of configuration must generated prior to the computations and, more often than not, should obey certain restrictions, concerning for instance their parity or the occupation of certain shells. -- While such lists can always be specified individually, here we show how to generate them from a set of *reference configurations* and by applying (a set of) *restrictions*. This automatic generation of configuration lists is particular helpful if electron capture, dielectronic recombination or cascades processes are to be studied. However, they also help support systematic enlargements of wave functions.\n"

The same restrictions can be applied to any given list of configurations if `noex = 0` is chosen in the call above, i.e. if no additional replacements are made. Moreover, since each of these restrictions are *tested* independently, its quite easy to add further restrictions if the user applies different computational models (or a different language) in specifying configurations of interest. However, already the presently available **restrictions** has been found useful in order to construct lists of configurations for dealing with Rydberg levels or for dielectronic recombination studies."
