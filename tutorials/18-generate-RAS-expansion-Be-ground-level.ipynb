    "In JAC, an restricted-active space (RAS) expansion is to a particular (atomic) representation and, more generally, refers to systematically enlarged SCF computations that are performed stepwise in order to include additional layers of active orbitals. RAS computations are based on one several *reference configurations*, a well-defined *level symmetry* for all CSF bases under consideration as well as on virtual single- (S), double- (D), triple-excitations (T), etc. of electrons from valence orbitals $\\to$ valence+virtual orbitals from the (so-called) *active* set. These SD++ excitations can be chosen differently for each step of the RAS computation, similar as the orbitals which are kept *frozen* during a particular step. More often than not, another layer of active orbitals is added and optimized in each step, while all orbitals from previous steps are kept frozen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we explain how a three-step RAS expansion for the $1s^2 2s^2\\: ^1S_0$ ground level of neutral beryllium as well as for its two lowest-excited $1s^2 2s2p\\: ^{1,3}P_1$ levels can be readily generated. For such a representation (of one or several atomic states), we first compute the orbitals for the $1s^2 2s^2$ reference configuration (in some configuration-average approach), and then stepwise enlarge the active orbitals by $2s,\\: 2p$ (step$_1$), $3s,\\: 3p,\\: 3d$ (step$_2$), and finally $4s,\\: ...,\\: 4f$ (step$_3$). In all these steps, the $1s$ orbitals as well as the orbitals from the previous steps are kept frozen to ensure a proper convergence of the orbitals.\n",
