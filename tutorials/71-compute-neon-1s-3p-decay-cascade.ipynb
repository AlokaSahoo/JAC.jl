    "Most excited atomic levels decay rapidly with lifetimes typically ranging from the femto- to the (meta-stable) micro-second regime; more often than not, this decay *proceeds* via many intermediate levels before the state of the atom or ion becomes stable. More specifically, here we shall talk about *atomic cascades* if (i) three or more charges states are involved in the excitation and/or decay cascade and (ii) if it becomes cumbersome to specify all the intermediate and final levels explictly. For such cascades, moreover, the observed ion distributions or the x-ray and electron spectra are usually much more interesting than the individual decay pathes or which intermediate levels contribute to the particular decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model such cascades theoretically, one requires of course both, the computation of a reasonably good -- excitation and decay -- data set as well as the proper *combination* of these data in order to make the theoretical results comparable to observations. In JAC, we therefore distinguish *two separate steps for all kinds of cascade computations:* **(1) The computation of the cascade tree**, i.e. of all transition amplitudes, rates and cross sections that appear in any physically allowed *decay path* of the atoms. Here, a *path* refers to a sequence of atomic transitions which either (explicitly) excite the atoms due to photoionization or electron impact, or which subsequently leads to the stabilization of the atom. Afterwards, **(2) a cascade simulation** need to be performed with the data from the cascade tree of step (1) in order to derive the physically requested information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, of course, *atomic cascades* may become very complex and unfeasible to compute. Therefore, in order to deal with such cascades, one often needs to restrict either the number of charge states, the atomic processes to be included into the cascade, the approach for describing the required wave functions, or several others features. The usual goal is to generate and process all amplitudes for the given *physical processes* (e.g. photon emission, Auger, photoionization, ...) *automatically*, while restricting the comptutions by means of some predefined approach or a few additional assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a very first example of an atomic cascde, we shall consider the decay of photo-excited $1s \\to 3p$ neon which either decays by autoionization of photon emission. In this example, we shall restrict ourselves to a very simple approach in generating all the necessary wave functions as well as to the simulation of the final ion and level distributions. Further properties, which can be simulated from the cascade tree data, will likely be considered in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In JAC, the (transition) data of a cascade tree is computed be means of a `Cascade.Computation()`, a container to keep all necessary information about the atom, its initial state, the maximum number of emitted electrons and other information as easily derived from the experimental set-up. We will easily understand the necessary input for such a cascade tree computation by: \n"

    "As seen from this definition of `Cascade.StepwiseDecayScheme`, several features about shake-up and -down processes are already prepared for input but not yet supported internally. For the moment, the `maxElectronLoss` is relevant as it determines the (maximal) number of charge states as well as the atomic processes to be considered in the automatic generation of the cascade tree. Below, we shall consider `Auger` and `Radiative` photon emission processes and, indeed, only these processes are supported  at present.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second and very relevant input parameter for a cascade tree computation is the `approach::Cascade.AbstractCascadeApproach` which determines the approach to compute all required intermedaite multiplets. Although there is not much freedom here at the moment, it is obvious that the quality of wave functions may affect the results considerably and, hence, *configuration mixing* of the levels from different configurations might be desirable to incorporate. On the other hand, one has to avoid any *double counting* of levels, and which is typically not so simple to recognize internally, since different *mixings* (multiplets) results in different level energies, a very important criterion to distinguish between different levels. In practice, this makes it necessary that every (electron) *configuration* may appear only once in any of the intermediate multiplets. Moreover, configuration mixing also results in more detailed CSF expansions of all atomic levels, i.e. into a *size factor* that later appears also *quadratically* in the computation of all individual transition rates and cross sections. Further work has to show how easily more sophisticated approaches can be realized in JAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "At present, only a `Cascade.AverageSCA()` approach has been realized, telling JAC that every electron configuration is treated independently to a single multiplet and without configuration mixing; in addition, here all continuum electrons are generated for an averaged energy between two such configurations. A few further assumptions are later recalled during the run, when the `Cascade.Computation` is performed. In the `Cascade.SCA` approach, later to be implemented, we shall allow full configuration mixing *within* each configuration as well as an improved treatment of the continuum orbitals."
