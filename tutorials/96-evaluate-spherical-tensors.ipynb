    "Spherical tensors are a *key concept* in atomic and nuclear (structure) theory and are central to most computations. While the daily use of JAC does not require much prior knowledge about these tensors, they often occur in the formulation, decomposition and simplification of matrix elements and transition amplitudes, and both at the single-, two- and many-electron formulation of the theory. The use of spherical tensor representations of atomic states, operators and density matrices plays an crucial role as they enable to decompose and simplify many expressions prior to their computations by using the theory of the SU$_2$ special-unitary and SO$_3$ rotation group. It is also very closely related to the use and handling of expressions from Racah's algebra."

    "In practice, the main goal in dealing with spherical tensors is the (symbolic) manipulation and simplification of products, matrix elements and (transition) amplitudes in spherical tensor notation. This includes (i) the separation of constant operators, external (field) operators and electronic operators that act upon the quantum states; (ii) the *reduction* of matrix elements and amplitudes towards (reduced electronic) matrix elements; (iii) the decompositon of matrix elements that refer to the spin and spatial parts of the associated Hilbert space; and (iv) the representation of many-particle amplitudes into reduced one- and two-particle matrix elements due to the one- and two-particle structure of most, if not all, physical interactions in Nature. To deal with these goals, different representations and distinctions of spherical tensors and tensor components are needed and are (partly) supported by the JAC program. To our knowledge, no other software exist that seriously supports the evaluation and simplification of matrix elements in spherical tensor representation. Apart from atomic structure and collision theory. these developements will be useful for nuclear-structure theory, atomic QED, crystalllography and, perhaps, even for astrophysics."
