    "which shows the internal definition and the constructors to define such a grid. In practice, there are three (logical) levels that are considered and realized for each grid: (i) The **phenomenological grid** definition that is based on our physics understanding and intuition of which grid is appropriate to decribe a particular atomic property or process. Two currently implemented grid refers to an *exponential* grid (with exponentially increasing stepsize) as appropriate for many bound-state computations and a *linear-logarithmic* grid that start exponentially but becomes linear in its stepsize for large values of $r$. Such a *linear-logarithmic* grid is typically needed to describe electron ionization and capture processes as the incoming or outgoing electron waves are *sinusoidal* and should be represented with a proper number of grid points, say 20-30, per period of the electron wave. In JAC, the *phenomenologically* part of the grid is chosen (analogue as in GRASP) by the parameters `rnt`, `h`, `hp` and `NoPoints` in the definition above. \n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) The *phenomenological* definition of the grid is internally translated into a **sequence of knots** upon which the B-spline primitives are defined. Here, each `nth` mesh point from the phenomenological is chosen to keep the number of B-splines and the corresponding size of matrices (that need to be diagonalized) moderate. These knots are used to define the B-splines and to determine the eigenvectors of all orbitals (within some given potential) but they are not applied in order evaluate matrix elements or radial integrals.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) The *phenomenological* grid and the definition of the B-splines (knots) are eventually combined into a **physical grid** upon which all radial functions are represented. This physical grid resembles the phenomenological grid but with modified grid points in between the *knots* of the B-spline grid\n",
    "(t-grid). Here the radial points and corresponding weights are chosen due to a Gauss-Legendre distribution and goal to determine all radial integrals *exact* up to a given *Gauss-Legendre order*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **physical grid** is thus defined by the three arrays `r` (the mesh points along $r$), `rp` (the derivatives d `r`/ dr), `rpor` (the values rp / r) as well as `w` (the corresponding weights).
