**Note:** The Julia package `SymEngine` is needed to perform symbolic simplifications of Racah algebra expressions in JAC but, by default, is not automatically loaded.

As mentioned before, the (data) type `RacahExpression` is very central to applying the techniques from Racah's algebra; see *LiveDocs*. This data type enables one to comprise -- less or more -- sophisticated expressions into a single Julia variable and to attempt its simplification by a set of internal (sum) rules. As seen from the definition of this (data) struct, the different 'delta' and Wigner symbols of such an expression are kept and maintained separately, so that the known sum rules can be applied more readily. Moreover, the last constructor of a `RacahExpression` shows that it quite simple to overwrite or extent an already existing RacahExpression, starting from a simple ùüô:
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° b0f8586c-db7e-4872-b4e3-ff6beafb4c6c
RacahExpression()

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 4c2b4d2a-4b34-4f6a-9690-6efc9f2d3fea
md"""
Perhaps, the simplest sum rules refer to the orthogonality of the Wigner 3-j and 6-j symbols; for example, the Wigner 6-j symbols fullfill the following orthogonality relations which can be displayed (just for illustration here) by looking up `RacahAlgebra.sumRulesForTwoW6j`. Both of the shown rules show that a summation over the product of two Wigner 6-j symbols can be re-written just in terms of some quantum numbers and triangle conditions. Note that $[a,b,...] = (2a+1)\: (2b+1)\: ...$. More general, all the implemented sum rules are displayed as inline comments in the code, although not as docstrings (apart from this particular function here).

*Typically, only some standard form of each sum rule is shown in the literature*, and many of these sum rules are just displayed in quite specialized texts about angular momenta. Likely, the most comprehensive compilation of these (and many other) rules can be found in the **monograph by Varshalovich et al. (1988)**. --- In general, however, one needs to recognize all the symmetries of a Racah expressions, implying all the phases and possible (weight) factors that arise from these symmetries. In JAC, this is realized by cycling automatically through all symmetric forms of the Wigner n-j (n = 3,6,9) symbols. In a later step, we also plan to take the spherical harmonics and the Wigner rotation matrices into account as well into the internal representation of a RacahExpression.

Again, let us first declare some Basic variables which we can later apply to define our first `RacahExpression`:

As before, we can simply evaluate this expression which attempts to apply one of the -- more than 45 implemented -- sum rules in order to reduce either the number of Wigner symbols and/or the number of summation indices:

This example looks perhaps quite *over-simplified* as we could use exactly the *orthogonaly relation* from above to get this result. However, the same simplification also works if we first randomly re-write the given Racah expression and then attempt its simplification again.

You may test this simplification several times for (randomly) different equivalent forms of `rex` and, likely, will receive slightly different results with regard to the number of symbols and summations. This is related to the **phase issue**, which refers to the fact that it is not easy to always recognize how the overall phase can be re-written internally so that a particular sum rule applies. Here, we note that the application of any sum rule always requests that all other parts of the given Racah expression, including its overall phase, must be independent of those parts which are to be removed. Further (formal) improvement on this **phase issue** might be possible but, sometimes, these equivalences need to be recognized and corrected manually.

Of course, we can simplify also less obvious Racah expressions, such as:

Apart from these quite simple expressions, much more complex ones rapidly arise if angular momenta are coupled together or re-coupled in order to allow the simplification of many-particle matrix elements.

In the next example, we shall consider the (so-called) re-coupling coefficients $ < (j_1, j_2) J_{12}, j_3: JM| j_1, (j_2,j_3) J_{23}: JM >$ which is known to be independent of $M$. The expression of this re-coupling coefficient can be written down quite easily by applying twice a Clesch-Gordan expansion on both sides of the 'overlap matrix element'. Simple manipulations gives immediately rise to the `RacahExpression`:
