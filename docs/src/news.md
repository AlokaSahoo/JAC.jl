# Recently implemented features and up-dates



# 2025

* **New B-Spline module:** The B-Spline bases of atomic orbitals has been re-implemented to make self-consistent-field
    computations more efficient. *(March'25)* 

* **Re-organized Plasma.Computation():** The computation of plasma properties have been expanded and re-organized 
    in order to support the `SahaBoltzmannScheme` and the `LineShiftScheme`. *(January'25)* 


# 2024

* **Dielectronic recombination into high-h shells:** New empirical and run-time features now support the efficient 
    computation of DR resonances strengths if the electron capture occurs into high-n (n > 15) shells.  *(October'24)* 

* **New and re-organized basic data types:** Several new abstract and concrete data types have been implemented
    (and re-organized) in the module `Basics`. *(August'24)* 

* **First design of empirical computations:** A new kind Empirical.Computation() has been established to support
    electron-impact ionization (EII) cross sections. *(March'24)*
