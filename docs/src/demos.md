The following Pluto.jl notebooks introduce the reader to JAC and demonstrate several features of this toolbox. ---
They can be explored statically at GitHub or can be run locally after the software repository has been cloned and installed.
Simply call Pluto.run() at the REPL ... and follow your Browser.
